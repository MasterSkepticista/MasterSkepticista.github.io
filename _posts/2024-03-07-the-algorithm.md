Good engineering is craftsmanship; and great engineers derive a healthy dose of dopamine from 'building' things.

Rocket science is the apex of 'engineering under constraints'. No wonder Elon came up with this 5-step "algorithm". I think this is a robust mindset to approaching engineering problems.

So, the algorithm:

### 1. Make your requirements less dumb
> Your requirements are definitely dumb.

Engineers (and by extension most leaf-level nodes in large organizations) tend to take what is handed to them
at face value.

Question each requirement. If a requirement does not make sense, talk to the **person** who imposed the requirement. Departments do not give requirements, people do. No matter who gave you the requirement, they may be wrong. It is particularly dangerous if a smart person gave you the requirement. Everyone is wrong at least some of the time.

### 2. Delete a part of the process 
It is enticing to confuse this with the notion of a [Chesterton's Fence](https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/):

> Do not remove a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place.

Instead put an active effort to understand each part of the process, and eliminate aggresively. If you are not adding things back 10-20% of the time, you are not deleting enough.

### 3. Simplify, or optimize
It is every smart engineer's tendency to optimize a thing that should not exist. Our education system incentivizes convergent logic - deduce the solution by applying finite rules. This is the mental equivalent of wearing a straitjacket. 

Focus on the weakest yet most impactful portion of your job, and iterate over that.

### 4. Accelerate cycle time
Only after you have done the other 3 things, accelerate your iteration time. 
> If you are digging your grave, don't dig it faster.

### 5. Automate
Don't reverse these steps.

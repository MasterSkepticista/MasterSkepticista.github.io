FLOPs requirement for extreme classification grows with the number of classes. We propose a LDA to be viewed as an `O(1)` classifier training algorithm that not only amortizes memory access and matrix multiply costs for training a given class, but at the same time provides continual learning capability.

In particular, we present:
1. XLDA: a framework for on-device Class-incremental learning where an LDA classifier is shown to be equivalent to a fully-connected layer in extreme classification scenarios.
2. Optimizations to enable XLDA-based training and inference on-device, under compute and storage constraints. We show upto **42x** speed up using a batched training approach and upto **5x** inference speedup with nearest neighbor search on extreme datasets like AliProducts (50k classes) and Google Landmarks V2 (81k classes).

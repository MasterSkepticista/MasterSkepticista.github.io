I'm currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Intel, building [OpenFL](https://github.com/securefederatedai/openfl) and OpenFL Security - an extension of OpenFL that leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to provide data, code and model confidentiality, and mitigates advanced threats in multiparty distributed systems.

Previously, I worked on on-device model training use cases in the healthcare and retail sectors. In 2022, my team deployed the [first](https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/health-it/aster-dm-intel-carpl-collaborate-for-secure-federated-learning-platform/92599071) SGX-based secure federated learning stack in India.

My interests include Deep Learning and Distributed Systems.

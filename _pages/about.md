I'm currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Intel in Bengaluru, building [OpenFL](https://github.com/securefederatedai/openfl) and Secure Federated AI Service. 

At Intel, I have been engaged in projects focusing on on-device model training, specifically within the healthcare and retail sectors. In 2022, my team deployed Indiaâ€™s [first](https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/health-it/aster-dm-intel-carpl-collaborate-for-secure-federated-learning-platform/92599071) SGX-based secure federated learning stack for chest X-ray anomaly detection. 

My research interests include deep learning, distributed training, and confidential computing. I also have experience with a variety of tools like OpenMPI, Docker and [Gramine](https://gramineproject.io/).

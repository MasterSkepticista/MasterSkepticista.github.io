<!-- Service and leadership
======
* Currently signed in to 43 different slack teams -->

<!-- * Developed a tool to capture membership inference attacks on synthetic MRIs generated from Diffusion models. -->
<!-- * Slashed training time of Object Detection Transformer from 10 days to 3.5 days (details [here](https://github.com/masterskepticista/detr)).
* Cut annual cloud spends by $112k - profiling and tuning repurposed training nodes for up to 94% scaling with 10GbE.
* Optimized ETL, deduplication, cleanup of 1.6M FHD images by 4.5x using TensorFlow and TFRecords. -->
<!-- * Deployed a ViT-based classification model across at KPN Retail, Coimbatore that brings INR 1.5cr of annualized revenue. -->
<!-- * Delivered multimodal RAG-based summarizer on Intel's internal GenAI LLM platform with >4,100 monthly avg users.
* Containerized Movidius Inference validation stack, reducing infra costs by **60%** and **12x** faster setup time. -->
